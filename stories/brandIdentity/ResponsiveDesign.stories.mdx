# Responsive Design

We use simplistic approach to make our layouts adaptive for most devices.

We use 3 types of layouts to display any type of components: Grid, Flex, Container (Flex with wrapper).import

More details bout layout components can be found in Components -> Layouts section

## Grid

Grid has a simplified responsive pattern. All grid layouts are displayed in 1 column on mobile devices.
It handles responsiveness pretty well in most cases... You can customize specific grid by overriding Grid StyledComponent.

## Flex

Flex components may need to change their flexFlow, depending on device. For that purpose we have ```adaptive``` prop.
We may add more specific customisation for Tablets in the future if needed.

## Containers

Containers have a max-width of 100% so they effect mostly desktop devices.

## Overview

We use very simple but elegant way to make adaptive layouts work with no customisation and parametrisation if possible.
In future we may consider some more complex components or new parameters if needed.
