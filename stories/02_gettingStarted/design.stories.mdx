# Getting Started Guide for Designers

The Origyn Design System is used to communicate brand identity and user interface components.
The aim is to create solutions that provide a well-balanced, system-wide user experience that seamlessly transitions from one app to another using a core set of components, modules, and animations.
The Origin UI Components acts as the foundation, containing the core components that can be applied to all user interface designs created for ORIGYN Art products.
The Getting Started Guide outlined on this page provides instructions on how to start work on ORIGYN Art designs.
