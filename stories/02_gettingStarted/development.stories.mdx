The documentation for each individual component provides more detailed information including:

- An overview with contextual usage guidance and best practices
- Examples of common variations of the component such as sizes and states
- Guidance for using the components with accessiblity in mind
- A detailed description of available React props along with an interactive playground environment

const theme = {
  colors: {
    BLACK: '#000000',
    WHITE: '#FFFFFF',
    ACCENT_COLOR: '#F5A506',
    LIGHT_GRAY: '#DFDFDF',
    LIGHTER_GRAY: '#F5F5F5',
    BG_GRAY: '#E5E5E5'
  },
  typography: {

  },
  spacing: {

  },
  media: {
    sm: '@media (max-width: 600px)',
    md: '@media (max-width: 960px)',
    lg: '@media (max-width: 1280px)',
    xl: '@media (max-width: 1920px)',
  },
  containers: {
    sm: 905,
    md: 1150,
    lg: 1400,
  }
};

...

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
