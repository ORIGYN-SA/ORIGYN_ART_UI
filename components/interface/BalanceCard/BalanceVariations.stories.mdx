# BalanceCard component variations

## Default BalanceCard

```typescript
interface BalanceCardProps extends BannerProps {
  balance: number;
  name: string;
  icon?: ReactNode;
  actions?: any;
}
```

BalanceCard has 2 required properties ```balance``` that descibes wallet balance, and ```name``` for wallet label.

## With icon

Optionally we can assign wallet icon for more visual representation of a specific wallet.

## Actions variation

For some cases we can not only display current walet balance, but also give the ability to deposit or withdraw.

## Color customisation

As BalanceCard extends BannerProps we can customize our card to use any colors we need to better represent a specific wallet.

```typescript
type BannerProps = {
  bgImage?: string;
  bgColor?: string;
  textColor?: string;
  padding?: string;
}
```
