# Card component

Card is default wrapper for content display. Page body has gray background to make card stand out more and separate
content chunks into different portions. Consider it as a basic content wrapper.

## Properties

Card has a consistent layout with padding and shadow parameters:

```typescript
type CardProps = {
  padding?: string;
  shadow?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
};
```

It also built on Flex component, so you can configure its layout with Flex component properties:

```typescript
type FlexProps = {
  justify?:
    | "flex-start"
    | "flex-end"
    | "center"
    | "space-between"
    | "space-around";
  align?: "flex-start" | "flex-end" | "center";
  flexFlow?: "column" | "row" | "column-reverse" | "row-reverse";
  fullWidth?: boolean;
  fullHeight?: boolean;
  gap?: number;
  relative?: boolean;
  adapt?: boolean;
};
```
